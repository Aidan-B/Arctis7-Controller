# Settings Change

This is two seperate captures. 

The first ([open-settings](./open-settings.pcapng)) captures the transmissions when the settings pane is opened while the headset is connected.

The second ([update-various-settings](./update-various-settings.pcapng)) captures individual packets that were sent to update the settings in the settings pane. There are comments on each packet describing the action that was taken.

The data for each update of a setting has been synthesized into [commands.txt](./commands.txt)
